    "# Types of Operators in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands. \n",
    "OPERATORS: These are the special symbols. Eg- + , * , /, etc.\n",
    "OPERAND: It is the values(3,4,78.8,78,'strings') on which the operator is applied.\n",
    "This guide covers various types of operators and their usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two operands.\n",
    "- **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.\n",
    "- **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two operands.\n",
    "- **Division (`/`)**: Divides the left operand by the right operand (result is always a float).\n",
    "- **Floor Division (`//`)**: Divides and rounds down to the nearest integer.\n",
    "- **Modulus (`%`)**: Returns the remainder of the division.\n",
    "- **Exponentiation (`**`)**: Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Comparison Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison operators are used to compare two values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Greater Than (`>`)**: Returns `True` if the left operand is greater than the right operand.\n",
    "- **Less Than (`<`)**: Returns `True` if the left operand is less than the right operand.\n",
    "- **Equal To (`==`)**: Returns `True` if the operands are equal.\n",
    "- **Not Equal To (`!=`)**: Returns `True` if the operands are not equal.\n",
    "- **Greater Than or Equal To (`>=`)**: Returns `True` if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.\n",
    "- **Less Than or Equal To (`<=`)**: Returns `True` if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Logical Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators are used to perform logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **and**: Returns `True` if both operands are `True`.\n",
    "- **or**: Returns `True` if at least one operand is `True`.\n",
    "- **not**: Returns `True` if the operand is `False`, and `False` if the operand is `True`.\n",

    "## 4. Bitwise Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Bitwise operators perform operations on individual bits of binary numbers.\n",
    "\n",

    "- `>>=`: Shifts bits to the right and assigns the result to the left operand.\n",
    "- `<<=`: Shifts bits to the left and assigns the result to the left operand.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Identity Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity operators are used to compare the memory locations of two objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **is**: Returns `True` if both operands are the same object.\n",
    "- **is not**: Returns `True` if both operands are different objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Membership Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "Membership operators are used to check for membership within a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **in**: Returns `True` if the left operand is present in the right operand (a sequence).\n",
    "- **not in**: Returns `True` if the left operand is not present in the right operand (a sequence).\n"

    "\n",
    "Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. They represent the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. In Python programming, since everything is an object, data types are actually classes, and variables are instances (objects) of these classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the standard or built-in data types in Python:\n",

    "- **int**: Integer values, e.g., 42, -10, 0. (Immutable, Ordered)\n",
    "- **float**: Floating-point or decimal values, e.g., 3.14, -0.001, 1.0. (Immutable, Ordered)\n",
    "- **complex**: Complex numbers, represented as `a + bj`, where `a` and `b` are floats and `j` is the imaginary unit. (Immutable, Not Ordered)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Sequence Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Sequence types represent ordered sets of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **list**: A collection of items which can be of different data types, enclosed in square brackets, e.g., `[1, 2, 'hello']`. (Mutable, Ordered)\n",
    "- **tuple**: An immutable collection of items, enclosed in parentheses, e.g., `(1, 2, 'hello')`. (Immutable, Ordered)\n",
    "- **str**: A string, a collection of characters, enclosed in either single or double quotes, e.g., `'hello'` or `\"world\"`. (Immutable, Ordered)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Boolean Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean type represents truth values, and it has two constant objects: `True` and `False`. (Immutable, Not Ordered)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Set Type\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is an unordered collection of unique elements, represented by curly braces `{}`, e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`. (Mutable, Not Ordered)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Dictionary Type\n",
    "\n",
    "A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, represented by curly braces `{}`, e.g., `{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}`. (Mutable, Not Ordered)\n",
